# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project
This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase of a Booking Management System. It focuses on identifying, analyzing, and structuring both functional and non-functional requirements to lay a strong foundation for successful software development. This simulation reflects real-world practices to help developers produce industry-standard documentation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate best practices in requirement analysis, including use case development, acceptance criteria, and system visualization. Each task in this project reflects a step-by-step approach to understanding and applying the principles of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
