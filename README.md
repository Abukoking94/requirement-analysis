# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project
This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase of a Booking Management System. It focuses on identifying, analyzing, and structuring both functional and non-functional requirements to lay a strong foundation for successful software development. This simulation reflects real-world practices to help developers produce industry-standard documentation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate best practices in requirement analysis, including use case development, acceptance criteria, and system visualization. Each task in this project reflects a step-by-step approach to understanding and applying the principles of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that ensures the final product meets user demands and business goals.

During Requirement Analysis, developers and analysts work closely with clients, users, and other stakeholders to identify both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform). This phase helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces project risks, and lays a clear foundation for design, development, and testing.

By thoroughly analyzing requirements early on, teams can prioritize features, estimate resources effectively, and avoid costly changes later in the development process. Overall, Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in delivering a successful, user-centered software product.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for several reasons:

1. **Ensures Clear Understanding of Needs**  
   It helps gather and clarify what stakeholders truly need, preventing misunderstandings and misaligned expectations.

2. **Reduces Risks and Costs**  
   Early identification of requirements reduces costly changes and rework during later development stages.

3. **Improves Project Planning and Resource Allocation**  
   Well-defined requirements enable accurate estimation of time, cost, and resources, helping teams plan and execute more effectively.

These benefits lead to the delivery of a software product that meets user needs and business goals efficiently and reliably.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis phase involves several important activities that ensure a thorough understanding and clear documentation of project needs:

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information about the project’s needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and research.

- **Requirement Elicitation:** Actively engaging with stakeholders to uncover detailed requirements, often using workshops, brainstorming, and discussions.

- **Requirement Documentation:** Organizing and recording requirements clearly and precisely in documents such as specifications and use case diagrams.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Examining requirements to detect conflicts, gaps, or redundancies, and creating models or diagrams to represent system behavior.

- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, completeness, and feasibility before proceeding to design and development.

- ## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors and functions the system must perform. They define **what** the system should do.

Examples for the Booking Management System:  
- Users can search for available properties by location and date.  
- Hosts can create, update, or delete property listings.  
- Users can book a property and receive a confirmation email.  
- The system must allow users to register and log in securely.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe **how** the system performs its functions and the overall quality attributes.

Examples for the Booking Management System:  
- The system should load search results within 2 seconds.  
- User data must be encrypted and securely stored to ensure privacy.  
- The platform should support at least 10,000 concurrent users.  
- The application must be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help clarify the system’s functionality by illustrating what users can do and how they engage with the system. These diagrams are valuable for understanding requirements, communicating with stakeholders, and guiding development.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**  
- Simplify complex system interactions into easy-to-understand visuals  
- Highlight system boundaries and user roles  
- Facilitate communication between technical and non-technical team members  
- Help identify all possible user actions and system responses

### Booking Management System Use Case Diagram

Below is a use case diagram for the booking management system. It shows key actors and their interactions with core system features like searching properties, managing listings, booking, and user authentication.
