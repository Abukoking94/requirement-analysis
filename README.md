# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project
This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase of a Booking Management System. It focuses on identifying, analyzing, and structuring both functional and non-functional requirements to lay a strong foundation for successful software development. This simulation reflects real-world practices to help developers produce industry-standard documentation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate best practices in requirement analysis, including use case development, acceptance criteria, and system visualization. Each task in this project reflects a step-by-step approach to understanding and applying the principles of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that ensures the final product meets user demands and business goals.

During Requirement Analysis, developers and analysts work closely with clients, users, and other stakeholders to identify both functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform). This phase helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces project risks, and lays a clear foundation for design, development, and testing.

By thoroughly analyzing requirements early on, teams can prioritize features, estimate resources effectively, and avoid costly changes later in the development process. Overall, Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in delivering a successful, user-centered software product.
